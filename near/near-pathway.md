# Access the NEAR Pathway

We no longer host the Pathway pages on this website, the content has moved to the `learn-web3-dapp` repository at <https://github.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp#-get-started>.

For less experienced developers or for anyone who wants to dive in without complicated setup, **[we recommend using Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp)** to work with the `learn-web3-dapp` project (this requires you to have a GitHub account to sign in). Gitpod can save you a considerable amount of time, as you don't have to install dependencies or set up a development environment - everything just works!

If you are an experienced developer, [cloning the repo locally](https://github.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp#-clone-locally) is still possible, however you might encounter various system configuration issues depending on how your local environment is set up. A minimum of NodeJS version 14.17 is recommended, and you'll want to make sure you have the `build-essential` package installed. You'll also want to make sure your Rust toolchain is up to date and that you have the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target triple set up and installed.
