## üïµüèª Querying the subgraph

After deploying the subgraph, we need to wait a little in order for it to sync with the Ethereum mainnet. It will scan past blocks to find events and then listen to any new events

We can follow the progression of the sync looking at the logged output by the running docker instance of our local graph node.

> Before, running the query you'll need to check you have a [metamask](https://metamask.io/) extension installed with your browser and you're connected to the mainnet of Ethereum. Why? We'll decorate the date returned by the GraphQL query with data coming from the [CryptoPunks Data](https://etherscan.io/address/0x16F5A35647D6F03D5D3da7b35409D65ba03aF3B2#readContract) to be able to render the images and other punk metadata.

Our Graph node come up with a GraphQL endpoint, available at [http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/punks](http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/punks/graphql). Open this in another tab and you will see a GraphiQL UI. Consider this a sandboz in which to experiment with queries. Open the right sidebar to explore your schema.

## üë®‚ÄçüíªYour turn! Qrite the GraphQL query

In `components/protocols/the_graph/graphql/index.ts`, write a GraphQL query to return the 10 most expensive CryptoPunks.

Some hints to help you:

- Start by just fetching for punks and passing all the fields you want back
- You will want `id`, `index`, `value` and `date`
- Then use `first`, `orderBy` and `orderDirection` to get 10 of highest value

Remember to use **GraphiQL IDE** at [http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/punks](http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/punks) to play around

## üëâ The solution

In `components/protocols/the_graph/graphql/index.ts` replace the GraphQL query with:

```graphql
// solution
query {
  punks(first: 10, orderBy: value, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    index
    owner {
      id
    }
    value
    date
  }
}
```
