## 🐳 Docker

In this pathway we'll use Docker to easily run a local Graph node on your machine. [You can install Docker here](https://www.docker.com). Make sure it's installed and running before going forward.

## 🔑 Get an Alchemy API key

We'll need to connect to the Ethereum mainnet to be able to listen to new events happening on the network. Alchemy is a blockchain development platform that provides access to Ethereum through their hosted nodes. 

To get an Alchemy API key, create an account [here](https://www.alchemy.com/) and create a new application. From that application dashboard, click on **View Details** and then on **View Key**. Copy the HTTP endpoint URL.

## 👣 Next Steps

Ok, enough of setup! Let's start getting our hands dirty with the first basic step: setting up a local Graph node to listen to the Ethereum network.
