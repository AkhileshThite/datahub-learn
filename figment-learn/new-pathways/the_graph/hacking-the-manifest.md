## üìú What's a "manifest"?

Like an orchestra, your subgraph is made up of a bunch of pieces that need to play nicely together for the music to sound good. Think of the the manifest as the conductor: it sits in the middle and coordinates everything.

If you open the repository in a code editor like Visual Studio Code, look for the folder called `subgraphs` and its child `punks`. It should look like this below. The manifest is the file called `subgraph.yaml`.

## üîé Inspecting the scaffolded file

Open the `subgraph.yaml` file and notice that it's already been populated using the information we provided but also with A LOT of things we didn't specify.

Under the `mappings` key we find `entities` and `eventHandlers` - the next steps of this tutorial will be dedicated to understanding them a bit more in depth. For now just notice the information that's below them. Remember the [code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB#code) from the CryptoPunk contract on Etherscan? They correspond to the Events emitted! The `eventHandlers` even have the right signatures already. That's promising.

## üßëüèº‚Äçüíª Your turn! Edit the manifest

Edit the manifest file to accomplish the 3 following things:
1) **Specify a starting block at `13100000`.** In order to save time when indexing the datasource, we must specify a starting block (or else the node would start indexing from the genesis block, which would take a veeeeery long time).
2) **Define only two entities "Punk" and "Account"** under the dataSources mappings.
3) **Only handle the `PunkBought` event** and name its handler `handlePunkBought`

# üëâ The solution

Replace the existing contents of `subgraph.yaml` with the following code snippet:

```yaml
// solution
specVersion: 0.0.2
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: punks
    network: mainnet
    source:
      address: "0xb47e3cd837dDF8e4c57F05d70Ab865de6e193BBB"
      abi: punks
      startBlock: 13100000
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.5
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      entities:
        - Account
        - Punk
      abis:
        - name: punks
          file: ./abis/punks.json
      eventHandlers:
        - event: PunkBought(indexed uint256,uint256,indexed address,indexed address)
          handler: handlePunkBought
      file: ./src/mapping.ts
```

## Make sure it works

Now, it's time for you to verify if you have followed the instructions carefully, click on the button **Test Manifest** to check that your manifest is well formed.
