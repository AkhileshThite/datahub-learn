In the following tutorials, we're going to interact with the Solana blockchain (and in particular its Devnet network) using the `@solana/web3.js` library. It's a convenient way to interface with the RPC API when building a Javascript application (under the hood it implements Solana's RPC methods and exposes them as Javascript objects). We will explore it together as we add features to our app.
