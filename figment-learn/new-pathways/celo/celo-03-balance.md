Now we have our account created, but wouldnâ€™t it be nice to keep track of cUSD and CELO balances. In this step, we will examine how we can do just that.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Celo blockchain has two native assets, **CELO** (CELO) and the **Celo Dollar** (cUSD). Both of these assets implement the `ERC20` token standard from Ethereum. The CELO asset is managed by the CELO smart contract and Celo Dollars is managed by the cUSD contract. 
{% endhint %}

------------------------

# Challenge

{% hint style="tip" %}
In `pages/api/celo/balance.ts`, complete the code of the **balance** function.
{% endhint %}

**Take a few minutes to figure this out**

```typescript
//...
  try {
    const { address } = req.body
    const url = getSafeUrl();
    const kit = newKit(url);

    const goldtoken = undefined;
    const celoBalance = undefined;
    
    const stabletoken = undefined;
    const cUSDBalance = undefined;


    res.status(200).json({ 
        attoCELO: celoBalance.toString(), 
        attoUSD: cUSDBalance.toString() 
    })
  }
//...
```

Still not sure how to do this? No problem! The solution is below so you don't get stuck.

------------------------

# Solution

```typescript
//...
  try {
    const { address } = req.body
    const url = getSafeUrl();
    const kit = newKit(url);

    const goldtoken = await kit.contracts.getGoldToken();
    const celoBalance = await goldtoken.balanceOf(address);

    const stabletoken = await kit.contracts.getStableToken();
    const cUSDBalance = await stabletoken.balanceOf(address);

    res.status(200).json({ 
        attoCELO: celoBalance.toString(), 
        attoUSD: cUSDBalance.toString() 
    })
  }
//...
```

**What happened in the code above?**
* First, we create a new `kit` instance.
* Next, we call `getGoldToken` method of `contracts` module to access CELO contract, then providing the input address to `balanceOf` return the balance of **CELO** token.
* Next, we call `getStableToken` method of `contracts` module to access CELO contract, then providing the input address to `balanceOf` return the balance of **cUSD** token.

{% hint style="tip" %}
The amount returned by is denominated in **aCELO** and **acUSD**, so to convert it to **CELO** and **acUSD** you'll need to divide it by 10**18 (a stand for `atto`)
{% endhint %}

------------------------

# Make sure it works

Once the code is complete and the file is saved, Next.js will rebuild the API route. Click on **Check Balance** and you should see the balance displayed on the page:

-----------------------------

# Next

Querying the balance information is fun, but being able to submit transactions and change the state of a blockchain is even better. In our next step, we will dive deeper and submit our first transactions on Celo.
