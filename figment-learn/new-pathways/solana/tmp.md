## The Pathway UI

Now visit the URL [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to see the All Pathways page:

![Click on the Polygon icon to begin your journey on the Polygon Pathway!](../../../.gitbook/assets/all_pathways.png)

In these tutorials we will cover connecting to and interacting with Polygon using the Metamask wallet, as this is the most common use-case even for development. Moving on, we will look at querying information from the blockchain and displaying it on the UI using the ethers library. Having tokens to test with is an important consideration, and we cover how to get test tokens from a faucet website. We will also discuss Solidity, the language used to write Ethereum and Polygon smart contracts. The basic workflow of writing, testing and deploying smart contracts will be the homestretch. We can then interact with the deployed contract to demonstrate its functionality!  

By the end of the Pathway tutorials, you will be confidently interacting with Polygon, sending transactions which cost fractions of a cent and deploying smart contracts.

## Next Steps

Now that we gave you a quick overview of Polygon ecosystem, we still need to set up our environment.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the Solana Pathway! We hope you had a fun time and learned a lot. Here are a few things you can check out to go further:

* Keep exploring the [Solana JS API](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/modules.html#sendandconfirmtransaction)
* Solana's [Hello World dApp](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld)
* Read some [programs written by Solana devs](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/examples)
* Look at the Solana's [Token Swap program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token-swap) \(~ Uniswap clone!\)
