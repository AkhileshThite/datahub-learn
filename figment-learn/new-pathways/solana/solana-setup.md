The following software is required to set up and complete the **Solana** Pathway :

* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.17.0 or higher installed
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed
* [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) latest release installed

> **Windows Users:** There are known compatibility issues with the Solana BPF toolchain. You will need to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Please refer to the [installation guide](https://docs.figment.io/network-documentation/extra-guides/solana-setup-for-windows) we have provided. 
>
> **macOS Users:** If you are using any of the Apple Silicon products (M1 processor), you may need to build from source. [Refer to this GitHub PR for more information](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/16346/).

Start by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies with yarn :

```text
git clone https://github.com/figment-networks/learn-web3-dapp.git
cd learn-web3-dapp
yarn
```

---------------------------

# Set your API key

Create an `.env.local` file at the root of the directory by copying the existing `.env.example` file with the terminal command `cp .env.example .env.local`.

The value for `DATAHUB_SOLANA_API_KEY` can be found on the [DataHub Services Dashboard](https://datahub.figment.io/services/solana). Click on the Solana icon in the list of available protocols and then copy your key as shown below. You can now paste your personal API key into `.env.local`. This will authenticate you and enable you to make JSON-RPC requests to the Solana cluster via DataHub.

# Start the server

With the API key in place, save the `.env.local` file and start the React interface with :

```text
yarn dev
```

Once the development server loads and compiles the application, open your default browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` :

> Did you know you can change the port? By default Next.js uses port 3000, but if you have another service already running on that port, use the `--port` flag, like `yarn dev --port 1122`.

--------------------------

# Using a Test Validator

At some point it may be useful to run a Test Validator. For example, if can't get airdrops because the Devnet faucet is not working. To run a local Test Validator, use this command in its own terminal tab or window :

```text
solana-test-validator
``` 

Use `solana config set` to target a particular cluster. After setting a cluster target, any future subcommands will send/receive information from that cluster. To target a running Test Validator with the Solana CLI:

```text
solana config set --url https://localhost:8899
```

You can see which cluster the Solana command-line tool (CLI) is currently targeting and the paths to your keypair and configuration file with the command :

```text
solana config get
```

---------------------------

# Keypair storage

During the Pathway, you will need to generate a keypair for use in the tutorials. This information is kept in the localstorage of your web browser, and is distinct from any keypairs generated by the Solana CLI. It can be accessed or cleared via the blue "Keypair" button at the top right corner of the Pathway UI, as shown below:

---------------------------

# Next

**NOTE**: The "Next Step" button on the pathway UI will be disabled until you have successfully performed the action of the curent step.

You can now move ahead to the instructions of the first tutorial step by clicking on the "Next" button below on the right. There are also links to the instructions for each step on the UI, for your convenience.
