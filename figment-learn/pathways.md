## ![](../.gitbook/assets/vhhp1wl4_400x400-1-.jpg) Learn Pathways

Learn Pathways are short curriculums that help developers understand which network is right for them and how to interact with Web 3 protocols at every step. Developers will have to complete a suite of tutorials that will help them set up their first dApp \(decentralized application\) via [**DataHub**](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up), even with little to no expertise with the selected protocol.

## ![](../.gitbook/assets/avalanche_token_round-300x300.png) Avalanche Pathway

Avalanche is a layer one protocol by Ava Labs that offers high-throughput, fast finality, and unprecedented decentralization. Developers are able to launch their own public or private blockchains \(called subnets\), create and trade digital assets, and build scalable smart contracts and decentralized applications.

**Get started with the Avalanche Pathway by visiting the page below.**

## ![](../.gitbook/assets/tnear_icon_1.png) NEAR Pathway 

NEAR is a decentralized application platform that is secure enough to manage high-value assets like money or identity and performant enough to make them useful for everyday people, putting the power of the Open Web in their hands.

## ![](../.gitbook/assets/4129.png)Polkadot Pathway

Polkadot enables scalability by allowing specialized blockchains to communicate with each other in a secure, trust-free environment. It is built to connect and secure unique blockchains, whether they be public, permissionless networks, private consortium chains, or oracles, and other Web3 technologies. It enables an internet where independent blockchains can exchange information under common security guarantees.

## Polygon \(Matic\) Pathway

_Polygon is a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum compatible blockchain networks. Aggregating scalable solutions on Ethereum, supporting a multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem._

Polygon is designed to interoperate with and solve some of Ethereum's limitations: Scaling, the speed of transaction throughput - and poor user experience such as the high cost of transactions. Polygon's testnets can currently reach over 7000 transactions per second and the low cost of the MATIC token means cheap transaction fees!

## ![](../.gitbook/assets/logo1.png) Secret Pathway

Secret Network is the first blockchain with privacy-preserving smart contracts. That means applications built on Secret can utilize encrypted data without revealing it to anyone, even the nodes in the network. For the first time, Secret Network allows developers to build powerful, permissionless, privacy-preserving applications - Secret Apps. Learn what makes it unique and build your first project.

## ![](../.gitbook/assets/2011%20%282%29%20%283%29%20%281%29.png) Tezos Pathway 

Tezos is an open-source platform for assets and applications that can evolve by upgrading itself. Stakeholders govern upgrades to the core protocol, including upgrades to the amendment process itself. ****It benefits from three main characteristics: self-amendment, on-chain governance, and decentralized innovation.
