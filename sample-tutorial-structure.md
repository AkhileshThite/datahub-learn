# Sample Tutorial Structure

# Introduction

Explain why this tutorial matters and what the context is. Explain what we're going to build and learn in this tutorial.

Explain this section like you're explaining it to 5-year-old (ELI5)

Explain everything in 5-6 lines maximum.

For example:

NEAR is a platform that allows anyone to create decentralized applications that can perform tasks without the need for a central entity. Building a Voting dApp is a good candidate for something that can showcase NEAR's power and potential. We're going to build a smart contract using solidity, front end with ReactJS and at the end, we will deploy our dApp on NEAR testnet.

# Prerequisites

Any prior knowledge needed or existing tutorials that need to be completed first, any tokens needed, mention them here.

For example -

In this tutorial, we're going to build a Voting dApp on NEAR using DataHub so before we proceed further make sure to complete the Tutorial 1 "Connect to NEAR Node using DataHub" of the NEAR Pathway​

Complete the Simple AssemblyScript App Tutorial, first.

# Requirements

Any technology that needs to be installed _prior to starting the tutorial_ and that the tutorial will not cover (Metamask, node, truffle, etc). 
**Do not** list packages that will be installed during the tutorial.

For example -

We'll need Metamask in this tutorial, install it from HERE​

Make sure to have NodeJS 12.0.1+ version installed

(OPTIONAL: Embed any video content here if you have any)

# Body of the Tutorial

Points to remember:

* Section headings like Introduction, Prerequisites, etc. **must all be H1: \#**, keep subheadings at H2: \##. H3: \### can be used for sub-section headings, but be aware that H3 does not show on the Table of Contents.

* Add all relevant Code Blocks with the proper syntax highlighting. 

* Add necessary comments in Code Blocks

* Add Text Content

* Add Output Images or Code Blocks to reflect expected terminal output

* Add common errors and steps to troubleshoot the errors, for example:

> Not able to connect to the Avalanche Node and getting error on executing node connect.js?
> Let's check for some common causes:
> First, make sure you have the `.env` file saved and that it's in the correct format as given in the tutorial.

> If you're getting an error message like UnauthorizedError: { "message":"Invalid authentication credentials" } then make sure to replace the <API_KEY> with your correct API key which you copied from your DataHub Dashboard. 
> Make sure to have your .env file saved in your project root folder.
> Make sure NODE_URL in .env file is correct
> If you are still experiencing the same issue, reach out to us for help on Discord or the Community Forums.
