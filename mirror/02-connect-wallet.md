# Step 2: Connecting a Wallet

The first step for any dApp is setting up a way to connect to a user's wallet. This allows the dApp to authenticate the user without using traditional passwords. More importantly, this allows the dApp to pull the user's onchain data to build user-specific dApp experiences.

Crypto wallets are the gateway through which users interact with blockchain protocols. The wallet locally stores a user's private keys encrypted by a password and allows the user to sign transactions that prove control of an account's keys in a trustless way. Developers can leverage this technology to authenticate users and build applications where users control their own data in a portable way.

In this case, we'll be using a JavaScript library called [ethers.js]() to interact with a user's browser extension wallet like [MetaMask](). This will allow us to detect whether the wallet is installed, and access the user account's API for getting its data and leveraging its functionality.

# Implementation üß©
The first step in performing any blockchain operation is typically instantiating a connection. This can be done by leveraging the **Providers** class in ethers.js. A provider object includes functionality to read from a protocol. There are several ways to implement this, but we'll leverage a simple implementation with **Web3Provider**.

```javascript
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
```

Once we have a provider, we can leverage the send method to request the accounts associated with the wallet. Then, we can instantiate a **Signer** object that will give us access to functions that allow us to change the state of the blockchain.

```javascript
await provider.send('eth_requestAccounts', []);
const signer = provider.getSigner();
const address = await signer.getAddress();
```

Going deep into something like the Ethereum Virtual Machine is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but this question is critical if you want to better understand the backend you're building on. Instead of connecting to a specific server and reading from a database, we're reading from a distributed state machine. It's distributed because there lots of nodes all over the world holding the same state. It's a state machine because it's in one state at any given time. We interact with it and compete with others using it to update a slice of its state that will get recorded before the next cycle restarts the same process.

If you're familiar with React development, you can probably guess that we'll need a way to preserve application state after we connect to the wallet. That way we don't have to make the user re-connect their wallet again. For this we'll use a context provider.

Furthermore, we should implement flow control for the logic above and consider abstracting it into a hook. There are several ways to implement so feel free to try different implementations to learn more.
