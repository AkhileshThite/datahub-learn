# Sample Tutorial Structure

## Introduction

Explain why this tutorial matter and what the context is, what we're going to build and learn in this tutorial.

* Explain this section like you're explaining it to 5 -year old
* Explain everything in 5-6 lines max

_For example -_

NEAR is a platform that allows anyone to create decentralized applications that can perform tasks without the need for a central entity. Building a Voting dApp is a good candidate for something that can showcase NEAR's power and potential_._ We're going to build a smart contract using solidity, front end with ReactJS and at the end, we will deploy our dApp on NEAR testnet. 

## **Prerequisites**

Any prior knowledge needed or existing tutorials that need to be completed first, any tokens needed, mention them here.

_For example -_

* In this tutorial, we're going to build a Voting dApp on NEAR using DataHub so before we proceed further make sure to complete the Tutorial 1 "Connect to NEAR Node using DataHub" of the [NEAR Pathway](../../network-documentation/near/tutorials/intro-pathway-write-and-deploy-your-first-near-smart-contract/1.-connecting-to-a-near-node-using-datahub.md)
* Complete the [Simple AssemblyScript App](../../network-documentation/near/tutorials/simple-webassembly-script.md) Tutorial, first.

## **Requirements**

Any technology that needs to be installed **prior** to starting the tutorial and that the tutorial will not cover \(`Metamask`, `node`, `truffle`, etc\). Do not list packages that will be installed in the tutorial \(`dotenv`\).

_For example -_

* We'll need Metamask in this tutorial, install it from [HERE](https://metamask.io/)
* Make sure to have NodeJS 12.0.1+ version installed

\[ Embed Video here if you have any, It's optional \]
