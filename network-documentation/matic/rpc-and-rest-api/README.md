# ðŸŽ® RPC & REST API

## Time to play 

If you're an Ethereum Developer, you're already a Matic developer. All the tools you're familiar with are supported on Matic out of the box: Truffle, Remix, Web3js. Switch over to Matic's RPC and get started! You will be able to leverage the [matic.js SDK](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic.js) which makes it easy for developers, who may not be deeply familiar with smart contract development, to interact with the various components of Matic Network.

This library will help developers to move assets from Ethereum chain to Matic chain, and withdraw from Matic to Ethereum using fraud proofs.
