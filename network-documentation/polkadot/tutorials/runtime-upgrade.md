# How do on-chain upgrades work and how to compile a runtime?

![](./assets/runtime-upgrade.png)

## Explaining the problem

Decentralization of blockchains has advantages and disadvantages, one of the major advantage is that there is no one central unit which has the whole power over a system. From the other side disadvantage is that in the environment without one central unit upgrading is hard due to coordination so many nodes at one time. One of the well known solution of upgrading blockchains is so called `hard fork` but as I have written has many potential vectors of attack and is hard to coordinate.

## Solution to the problem

The unique and newest solution how to make upgrade of decentralized system based on Substrate framework is called `runtime-upgrade`. The solution works smoothly and in the article I will show you how you can upgrade your Substrate based chain on your machine, locally and be honest - it is quite easy. This is how adaptability is implemented in Substrate.

## Prerequisites

You have very basic knowledge about Rust language and Substrate framework.

## Let's start coding

During the tutorial we are going to make following steps:
1. build the simplest Substrate based blockchain
2. run locally the blockchain
3. add a new feature to runtime
4. build WASM file
5. verify of the upgrade - check version

Upgrading runtime state transition function consists of following steps: 

- bump spec_version
- build wasm file
  - `WASM_TARGET_DIRECTORY="$(pwd)" cargo build`
- Use sudo to perform runtime

### Ad. 1: Building the simplest Substrate based blockchain

Checkout https://github.com/TomaszWaszczyk/substrate-runtime-upgrade-tutorial (master branch) then execute `make init` and after around 10 minutes (depends on performance of your machine) you should see something like:

```
Compiling sc-finality-grandpa v0.8.0
Compiling rocksdb v0.15.0
Compiling kvdb-rocksdb v0.9.1
Compiling sc-client-db v0.8.0
Compiling sc-service v0.8.0
Compiling sc-cli v0.8.0
Compiling frame-benchmarking-cli v2.0.0
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 13m 01s
```

Hint: If you want build optimized version of the project execute `cargo build --release`

### Ad. 2: Run locally blockchain

Execute `make run` command:

```

We can see that kitties pallet has only `create()` function, it is out current state transition - runtime. What we are going now is to show how adaptable Substrate based blockchains are, we add new feature (breed function)  

## Ad 3: Add a new feature to runtime

Before upgrade `spec_version` was equal to `1`, now while making upgrade we have incremented the field into `2` like below:

```rust
pub const VERSION: RuntimeVersion = RuntimeVersion {
	spec_name: create_runtime_str!("node-template"),
	impl_name: create_runtime_str!("node-template"),
	authoring_version: 1,
	spec_version: 2, // incremented version
	impl_version: 1,
	apis: RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS,
	transaction_version: 1,
};
```

Our upgrade will add a new function to `kitties` pallet called `breed`, here is the implementation:

```rust
/// Breed kitties
#[weight = 1000]
pub fn breed(origin, kitty_id_1: u32, kitty_id_2: u32) {
  let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;
  let kitty1 = Self::kitties(&sender, kitty_id_1).ok_or(Error::<T>::InvalidKittyId)?;
  let kitty2 = Self::kitties(&sender, kitty_id_2).ok_or(Error::<T>::InvalidKittyId)?;

  ensure!(kitty1.gender() != kitty2.gender(), Error::<T>::SameGender);
    
  let kitty_id = Self::get_next_kitty_id()?;

  let kitty1_dna = kitty1.0;
  let kitty2_dna = kitty2.0;

  let selector = Self::random_value(&sender);
  let mut new_dna = [0u8; 16];

  // Combine parents and selector to create new kitty
  for i in 0..kitty1_dna.len() {
    new_dna[i] = combine_dna(kitty1_dna[i], kitty2_dna[i], selector[i]);
  }

  let new_kitty = Kitty(new_dna);

  Kitties::<T>::insert(&sender, kitty_id, &new_kitty);
  Self::deposit_event(RawEvent::KittyBred(sender, kitty_id, new_kitty));
}
```

After addition of `breed` function in `kitties` pallet we need to build WASM file.

Here is a link to the whole new implementation: https://github.com/TomaszWaszczyk/substrate-runtime-upgrade-tutorial/blob/after-runtime-upgrade/pallets/kitties/src/lib.rs

After making upgrade we expect that `kitties` pallet will have `breed` function without stopping running chain. Real adaptability of the blockchain.

### Ad. 4: Build WASM file - runtime

Execute following command in order to build runtime wasm file: `WASM_TARGET_DIRECTORY="$(pwd)" cargo build`

After successfully build we expect to have a new file should appear in current directory:

![](./assets/wasm.png)

## Ad 5: Upgrade runtime and verify version

We have running node with version `1` and upgrade runtime into version `2`, we expect that version should change to version `2`. If it will happen it proves that we have upgraded working chain. Proof of successfully making upgrade runtime will be our freshly added `breed` function. Let's check it.

In order to make upgrade go to `Developer` tab, select `Sudo`. Then make sure that you have selected `system` pallet and `setCode(code)`, check in `file upload` and select freshly created WASM file made in previous step `node_template_runtime.wasm` then check in `with weight override` and in the field `unchecked weight for this call` type example value like `100`. To confirm making upgrade click on `Submit Sudo Unchecked`.

![](./assets/upgrade.png)

After successfuly upgrade you should see updated `spec_version` and have access to our new function:

![](./assets/after-upgrade.png)

On the screenshot we can see successfully upgrade, take into consideration that the version of `spec_version` has been changed to incremented value `2`.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Problem: First build could be not easy

The possible issue you can face with while building is error shown below, it means that you do not have installed proper version of Rust language.

### Solution - configure and make default proper version of Rust language on your machine

You need to install and make default `rustup update nightly-2020-08-23` Rust language

1. Installation

`rustup update nightly-2020-08-23`

2. Make default version

`rustup default nightly-2020-08-23-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

3. Checking of default version

`rustup show` and in the output you should see following output:

``
active toolchain
----------------

nightly-2020-08-23-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
rustc 1.47.0-nightly (663d2f5cd 2020-08-22)
``
