# It's Time to Put a STAKE Pool in the Ground!

In my last tutorial, [It's Time to Put a STAKE in the Ground!][1], I shared with you my STAKE vision. That time has arrived. 
Since then, I have been busy building the next generation staking pool contract as a gift for all in the NEAR community.
The new OysterPack SMART STAKE Pool contract is ready for use on the NEAR testnet network. The project is fully open source
and freely available on GitHub: [OysterPack SMART][2]. The new OysterPack SMART STAKE Pool contract also showcases the
**OysterPack SMART NEAR Component Based Framework**. The agenda for this tutorial is:

1. Show you the benefits that the OysterPack SMART STAKE pool provides 
2. Show you how to use the STAKE pool contract as a validator
3. Show you how to use the STAKE pool contract as a delegator
