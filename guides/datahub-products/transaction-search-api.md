# Transaction Search API

## Overview

DataHub’s transaction search API allows developers to query blockchain data like never before. Users can filter transactions by account, transaction type, memo field, smart contract address, and date range, providing full flexibility akeen to Web 2 data processing. Developers can also query a wide selection of protocol events like upcoming blocks and transactions, which can then be filtered by block height, action, and more. This means customers of all sizes, from small app developers to exchanges and custodians can use it to provide their users with transaction history, and create special triggers based on incoming and outgoing transactions. 

Transaction Search cuts significant indexing and development time as well as maintenance resources so you can build the next generation of Web 3 applications in no time! 

## Benefits 

### Industry-leading performance, scalability, and availability

Query historical transactions and future events in an instant, without upfront investments or extra development time. Transaction Search is designed for 99.9% uptime and robust data durability so transactions and events are always available when you need them, even when the protocol suffers from high latency. 

### Unmatched search flexibility 

Search transactions and protocol events any way you want, if it has happened, it’s been indexed. Filter transactions by hash, block hash, block height, sender or receiver account name, date range, and memo field. Filter protocol events by block height, action and type. Automatically port from 1 protocol version to the next without any extra work. Transaction Search is designed with developers’ needs in mind. 

### Standardized development across protocols 

Whether you are on Celo, Polkadot, Terra, or any of our supported protocols, search transactions exactly the same way so you don’t have to write additional code. It offers a one-time API integration, giving you access to multiple protocols within the same interface. Transaction Search is a JSON API that is easy to manipulate and integrate in your DApp. 

## How it works 

The Transaction Search API gathers data \(like blocks, transactions, and smart contract information\) and maps it into a standardized format across protocols. It then indexes all the data accordingly allowing searches on different parameters.
