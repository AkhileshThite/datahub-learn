# üë©‚Äçüè´ What is Figment Learn?

## üëì Overview

Figment launched Learn to educate and onboard developers to Web 3 protocols. 
With Learn, developers gain access to comprehensive practical tutorials developed by Figment and the community to foster the ecosystem‚Äôs growth.
Tutorials, in the form of guided Pathways, can be completed seamlessly with DataHub which provides easy access to the protocols via our highly available full node infrastructure and suite of middleware. To foster its community, Figment is partnering with foundations to reward developers for building on Web 3 protocols and sharing their knowledge with others. Figment Learn is the Web 3 Knowledge Base!

## üö¶ The Problem Today

Many promising Web 3 protocols are getting to market and are looking to introduce more developers to their unique features while fighting for the same market share. With each new protocol launch, the barrier to entry to Web 3 development increases. Developers looking to leverage the power of blockchain technology first need to learn about decentralized protocols, understand which one is right for their project, and finally master their unique characteristics to start building. It‚Äôs an uphill battle for developers who not only need to learn new languages and adopt a new tech stack but also find the right resources that will help them become better Web 3 developers.

## üö© How Learn Helps

Figment Learn aims to solve these problems by guiding developers throughout that process. 
With Learn, developers can understand which network is right for them and actually interact with the protocol at each step of their learning process. 
Newcomers are provided with a short curriculum in the form of tutorials which helps them set up their first dApp (decentralized application) via DataHub, even with little to no expertise on a given protocol. As they complete the tutorials, developers will become more skilled and able to build quickly on a given protocol.

## ‚≠ê Building the Web 3 Knowledge Base

Figment Learn‚Äôs main objective is to build a community where developers are not only incentivized to _learn_ but also to _share_ with others, and are rewarded for doing so. 

In order to create the most comprehensive Web 3 knowledge base, we reward community members who publish tutorials to accelerate the pace of innovation in Web 3.
Tutorial contributors earn protocol tokens for their efforts and grow their status as protocol experts among their peers. 
With this dual approach, Figment Learn ensures that developers can not only understand the basics of new protocols but also dig deeper into unique use cases that will spark the next wave of mainstream applications. Learn becomes the strongest alignment mechanism between protocols and developer communities who are now incentivized to see the value of the network and its tokens grow.

# üöÄ Why Build on Web 3?

Web 3 is the next generation of the Internet. Web 3 (also known as the decentralized web) promises to make the Internet more free, transparent, and user-focused. Users of Web 3 will be in complete control of their accounts, data, transactions, and identity. The vision of Web 3 is coming to life today, and its foundation is being built by thousands of developers and designers across the globe.

## üåç The Internet Today

People are more connected than they have ever been in history. Today, 62% of the world‚Äôs population uses the internet in some way, shape, or form. 25 years ago, that number was 0.4%. The past 25 years of innovation have given us the ability to freely interact, share, and collaborate with others on a global scale; this is what we call Web 2. Developers today have access to billions of potential users the second they host or upload their website or application to the web, but this unprecedented connectivity comes with a hidden price.

## üõëProblems with Web 2

The innovation of Web 2 has given the world a tremendous positive impact, but its negative impact is becoming [**ever more present**](https://medium.com/@essentia1/web-2-0-is-broken-its-time-for-a-new-paradigm-shift-2a4b1fc2ff60). Issues around centralization, privacy, censorship, and ownership of digital goods have limited the previous utopian vision of the limitless connectivity that Web 2 offers.

## ‚úÖ Web 3 Solution

Blockchain technology and Web 3 based protocols are poised to solve the problems created during the Web 2 revolution. The [**Web 3 revolution**](https://blog.coinbase.com/understanding-web-3-a-user-controlled-internet-a39c21cf83f3) will create an Internet that is truly decentralized where users can freely interact, share, collaborate, and even exchange goods and services at a global scale in a trustless environment.

**Decentralized** - Users of decentralized protocols do not have to trust a centralized authority and developers do not have to rely on a single point of failure.

**Private** - Privacy-preserving blockchains give users the ability to choose who and what information they wish to share ensuring developers that their sensitive information is safe.

**Censorship Resistant** - Information stored on public blockchains cannot be manipulated or deleted, which gives users and developers the ability to constantly access it.

**Digital Ownership** - By leveraging smart contracts and NFTs \(non-fungible tokens\), developers can create ways for content creators and artists to monetize the full value of their creations.

## üöÜ Moving Forward

In order to succeed, Web 3 will need to rely on its greatest strength, which is the community of builders, leaders, and entrepreneurs that have been inspired by the promise of Web 3. At Figment, our mission is to support the adoption, growth, and long-term success of the Web 3 ecosystem.

We know firsthand how difficult it is to launch a new product or application, and we understand that developers need to have the appropriate resources to capitalize on Web 3‚Äôs unique characteristics. This is why we make it simple to build the next generation of the Internet. We provide developers with high-quality developer tools & documentation, a library of written & streamable educational material, and a diverse community in order to ensure success.
