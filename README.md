# üíª What is DataHub?

## üëì Overview

DataHub empowers developers to use the most powerful and unique features of a blockchain _without having to become protocol experts_. 
With DataHub, developers now have access to Web 3 protocols through our enterprise-grade infrastructure. We make sure they can focus on what they do best: develop amazing products. 

DataHub provides easy, reliable access to the RPC and REST APIs of our supported protocols for both the latest mainnets and testnets, so our users can test and implement their products safely. DataHub also provides Enriched APIs to complement the available RPC and REST APIs of some protocols, allowing developers to view and manipulate Web 3 data in advanced ways so they can build the next Web 3 killer apps!

# üë©‚Äçüè´ What is Figment Learn?

## üëì Overview

Figment launched Learn to educate and onboard developers to Web 3 protocols. 
With Learn, developers gain access to comprehensive practical tutorials developed by Figment and the community to foster the ecosystem‚Äôs growth.
Tutorials, in the form of guided Pathways, can be completed seamlessly with DataHub which provides easy access to the protocols via our highly available full node infrastructure and suite of middleware. To foster its community, Figment is partnering with foundations to reward developers for building on Web 3 protocols and sharing their knowledge with others. Figment Learn is the Web 3 Knowledge Base!

## üö¶ The Problem Today

Many promising Web 3 protocols are getting to market and are looking to introduce more developers to their unique features while fighting for the same market share. With each new protocol launch, the barrier to entry to Web 3 development increases. Developers looking to leverage the power of blockchain technology first need to learn about decentralized protocols, understand which one is right for their project, and finally master their unique characteristics to start building. It‚Äôs an uphill battle for developers who not only need to learn new languages and adopt a new tech stack but also find the right resources that will help them become better Web 3 developers.

## üö© How Learn Helps

Figment Learn aims to solve these problems by guiding developers throughout that process. 
With Learn, developers can understand which network is right for them and actually interact with the protocol at each step of their learning process. 
Newcomers are provided with a short curriculum in the form of tutorials which helps them set up their first dApp (decentralized application) via DataHub, even with little to no expertise on a given protocol. As they complete the tutorials, developers will become more skilled and able to build quickly on a given protocol.

## ‚≠ê Building the Web 3 Knowledge Base

Figment Learn‚Äôs main objective is to build a community where developers are not only incentivized to _learn_ but also to _share_ with others, and are rewarded for doing so. 

In order to create the most comprehensive Web 3 knowledge base, we reward community members who publish tutorials to accelerate the pace of innovation in Web 3.
Tutorial contributors earn protocol tokens for their efforts and grow their status as protocol experts among their peers. 
With this dual approach, Figment Learn ensures that developers can not only understand the basics of new protocols but also dig deeper into unique use cases that will spark the next wave of mainstream applications. Learn becomes the strongest alignment mechanism between protocols and developer communities who are now incentivized to see the value of the network and its tokens grow.
