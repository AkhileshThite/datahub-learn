# Figment Learn Guidelines for Users

Figment Learn aims to reward developers who are eager to improve their Web 3 skills. There are exclusive NFTs available for devs who complete multiple Pathways.

Figment Learn Pathways are designed to give you hands-on experience with blockchains & cover the fundamentals of Web 3 development. The programming languages most commonly in use regarding proof-of-stake blockchains are JavaScript/TypeScript, and Rust. There are many frameworks and tools that rely on JavaScript to communicate between the user and blockchain. Rust is quite powerful and offers an alternative learning path to JavaScript and Solidity.
